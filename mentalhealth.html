            <h1><u>Importance of Biodiversity Conservation</u></h1>
            <h2>1. Biodiversity conservation is important for economic growth and poverty reduction</h2>
            <p>This argument is based on the numerous direct economic benefits that humans derive from natural environments such as food, construction material, fiber, firewood, industrial products, and medicinal value.

                As an example, approximately 25,000 plant species are used by native people to extract traditional medicine. Plus, more than 25% of drugs sold worldwide are derived from plants. And according to the UN, the majority of the world’s poor lives in rural areas and depend upon wetlands, forests, pastures, and water for their livelihoods.
                
                
                Billions of people worldwide also depend on timber products for income and subsistence. The national parks and sanctuaries are a source of tourism that amaze people as a source of natural beauty.</p>
            <h2>2. Supports the continuity of various ecosystems globally</h2>
            <p>Biodiversity plays an essential role in ecosystem rejuvenation and protection. The Amazon forest, for example, can produce approximately 20% of the total oxygen on earth through photosynthesis.


                There are also thousands of pollinators such as insects and birds, and other numerous biological activities that take place in the forest. If the biodiversity of the forest is conserved, it means the entire ecosystem that relies on the Amazon forest is equally protected and allowed to rejuvenate.
                
                Other ecosystems like the coral reefs, tundra, rivers and streams, and grasslands can as well be supported and protected through biodiversity conservation.</p>
            <h2>3. Aesthetic value</h2>
            <p>The natural environment provides great pleasure to human beings with its shape, structure, senses, and color, which enriches people’s culture. Activities such as visits to animal parks, bird watching, nature art, and cultural heritage as ways of enjoying and appreciating nature are only made possible through biodiversity conservation.</p>
            <h2>4. Ecological balance</h2>
            <p>The integrity of the ecology – the harmonious coexistence of organisms and their environment is preserved by biodiversity. Some of the main aspects can be explained through:


                Carbon dioxide and oxygen balance (which helps in addressing the effects of climate change). The sequential balance between atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen are maintained through biodiversity. Failure to conserve biodiversity leads to the accumulation of carbon dioxide resulting in a greenhouse effect and the gradual depletion of ozone. The results are global warming and natural calamities.
                Biochemical cycles. An example is a hydrological cycle. The availability of biological resources such as forests and wetlands are vital for biochemical cycles. Lack of these resources would lead to incomplete cycles and increased incidences of natural calamities like desertification and species extinction.
                Decomposition. Biodiversity conservation protects decomposers – organisms that aid in the breakdown of waste organic matter. Decomposition is thus an essential part of the food chain as it transforms the waste of dead organic matter, which is then converted into other biochemicals that are availed for primary producers.
                Climate. The maintenance of the micro, local or regional climate is determined and regulated by biodiversity. Biodiversity achieves this by influencing the air turbulence, temperature, and precipitation.
